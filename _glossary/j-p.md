# JSON
Javascript Object Notation, a general purpose format like CSV.

# Keywords
words used in an information retrieval system to indicate the content of a document.

# localStorage Cache
allows an application to store data locally, in a user's browser. Storing information on the browser's local storage cache (instead of a normal file cache) means that if you use a different browser to access the mdEditor, it will not show the data you've imported from your first browser. It also means that if you clear your browser's cache, it will generally not clear your mdEditor records. However, depending upon your browser settings (E.g., in Chrome, if the "cookies and other site data" option is checked), clearing your browser cache may still clear your mdEditor data.

# mdEditor
a web application used to write archival-quality metadata for projects and data resources. mdeditor.org​
mdEditor File: contains all of the information contained in mdJSON, along with mdEditor settings. This can be exported and shared with collaborators, imported into another record set, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy.

# mdJSON

# Metadata
data that describes and provides additional information about other data to promote discoverability and proper use.

# Open Format
data format that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information.

# Project
a discrete effort on a particular topic with defined objectives or goals.

# Project Management
